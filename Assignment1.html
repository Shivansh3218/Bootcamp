Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife, Maria.
 Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his father's footsteps,
  inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents' untimely death. Tony took Stark Industries to new heights of success, eventually he made an armoured suit and came to be known as iron man. He is the most loved character of marvel cinematic universe. </p>
